            I'm a senior at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and The Peabody Institute of Music double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and minoring in Music.
            In the summer of 2025, I was accepted into JHU's Robotics Master's Program, which I'm track to complete by December, 2026.
            I'm very fortunate to be a <a href="https://apply.jhu.edu/tuition-aid/types-of-financial-aid/need-based-scholarships/clark-scholarship/" target="_blank">Clark Scholar</a>, where I'm 1 of 10 selected students who work on engineering and business/entrepreneurship projects, collaborating with NATO and U.S. Military officers.
            I recently received the 2025 <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/academics/undergraduate-studies/student-awards-and-honors/" target="_blank">William H. Huggins award</a> in JHU's Electrical and Computer Engineering department, which was given in "outstanding scholarship and service to the department and to fellow students".

        <p>I am also a classical pianist and, along with my brother, form a piano duo called <a href="https://www.thepianoboys.com" target="_blank">ThePianoBoys</a>.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to performing classical works, I greatly enjoy music composition, improvisation, and theory, all of which I discuss more about in <a href="https://www.blog.zeyn.schweyk.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>.
            Here is a playlist of a few of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVwCJZ4e7LgZ-fi2Ty8V5RPfVw5RuvFuZ" target="_blank">my compositions</a> thus far, some of which have won county and state level awards from various organizations, including the Composers Today Symposium in California.</p>

            In my free time, I've created a few stock/options services for friends and family. I'm currently working on an all-in-one site to
            consolidate all the services. In the meantime, please contact me if you're interested.
