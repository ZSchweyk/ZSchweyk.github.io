        <p>My Ph.D research broadly aims to develop new techniques for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">design and analysis of control systems</a> that can achieve various notions of efficiency and robustness in electrical and mechanical engineering applications. The novelty of my work lies in its creative use of ideas from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory">stability theory</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system">nonlinear systems</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system">hybrid systems</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion">differential inclusions</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_recurrence_with_constant_coefficients">difference equations</a>. So far, my work has offered new and practical perspectives on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8637145">reset control</a>, a topic that has been gaining popularity in recent years among researchers across several engineering disciplines.</p>

        <p>Reset control is a technique that augments traditional dynamic feedback controllers with a mechanism to adaptively and/or periodically "reset" the memory state in such a way as to improve transient closed-loop behaviors such as overshoot and settling time. Reset controllers have been shown to overcome inherent limitations in the phase lag properties of linear time-invariant controllers, including proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The benefits have been demonstrated in a wide variety of applications: industrial high-precision motion systems with unknown friction characteristics; longitudinal motion in a coordinated platoon of automatically cruising vehicles; exhaust gas recirculation valves; and electromechanical valves in power-split transmission systems.</p>

        <p>Despite their effectiveness for controlling linear systems, reset controllers have not been extensively applied to nonlinear systems (at the time of this writing), partly due to challenges in guaranteeing desirable properties regarding stability and robustness in this setting. One specific challenge lies in implementing a feature referred to as temporal regularization, which enforces a positive lower bound on the time elapsed between instances of resetting and has been shown to be essential for stability/robustness guarantees in reset control.</p> 

        <p>My research takes a step toward addressing these challenges by applying reset control to passive systems, which are (generally) nonlinear systems that commonly arise in vehicular and robotic applications, among other applications that involve nonlinear interactions between mechanical and/or electrical components. By exploiting the fact that these systems admit energy functions for stability analysis, I have developed a new type of reset controller referred to as a soft-reset controller, whose stability properties can be guaranteed by exploiting convexity of energy functions and without relying on temporal regularization. Specifically, it is shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11414">[Le, Teel 2021b]</a> that, if a reset controller admits a strongly convex energy function, there exists a soft-reset controller that approximates the behavior of the original reset controller while inheriting its stability and passivity properties, enabling the soft-reset controller to achieve desired closed-loop stability and passivity properties when placed in feedback interconnection with a passive nonlinear system. In the same publication, soft-reset control is demonstrated on some systems commonly studied in nonlinear control theory, including a robotic manipulator and a translational oscillator with a rotational actuator.</p>

        <p>In one of my earlier works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13770">[Le, Teel 2021a]</a>), a technique inspired by reset control is demonstrated on convex optimization algorithms, which are algorithms that are widely used in statistical data analysis, among many other applications, and can be modeled as nonlinear systems. This work develops a numerical approach, based on linear matrix inequalities, to certify exponential rates of convergence for reset-based optimization algorithms that are implemented in the discrete-time domain. In addition, it is demonstrated through numerical experiments that resets can greatly improve the efficiency of optimization algorithms when applied to statistical problems such as logistic regression.</p>

        <p>The animation shown below depicts a preliminary application of reset control to a problem of formation control in a leader-following multi-agent system, where each agent is simulated with a simple model of holonomic vehicle dynamics with friction. In this simulation, the controllers are severely information-restricted in the sense that they do not know the desired positions associated with each formation, nor do they anticipate the times at which the desired formation switches; each agent only knows the desired displacement vector to be maintained relative to a neighboring agent's position. It is seen here that the reset controller can consistently reduce the unhelpful and wasteful behaviors of the standard controller: at certain times, the “overshoot” behaviors are reduced, while at other times, the redundant “backtracking” behaviors are reduced. Overall, the reset method yields trajectories that are more regular and more akin to what a human operator might produce when manually controlling the vehicles with full knowledge of the desired formations. More details on this application of reset control, among others, can be found in my <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9fk024rz">dissertation</a>.</p>
