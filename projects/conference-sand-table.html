    <p>
      During my high school senior year at the <a href="https://www.dpengineering.org/" target="_blank">Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy (DPEA)</a>, I acquired the necessary hardware and Raspberry Pis, and wrote the software from scratch for a Conference Sand Table,
      meant to be sold to a company for use during conferences, or displayed at the Moxi science museum in Santa Barbara, CA or the Exploratorium in San Francisco.
      I also did some occasional CAD and lazer cutting for smaller mechanical components.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table is about 6-feet in diameter with an arm that spans the diameter of the table, and two marbles attracted to strong permanent magnets whose distances can vary from the center of the table via motors and lead screws. 
      These marbles sit and move around in sand to create designs based off of user-defined polar equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Electronics:
      <ul>
        <li>3 <a href="https://odriverobotics.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqFAUHfJkLc4q8sQra63uPROIvIGZfI-_QqDkfbFTj_x0cjyQ21">ODrive</a> motors (powerful servos) - 2 at the center of the table controlling the radii of the marbles (r1 and r2), and 1 below the table controlling the angular velocity of the diameter arm</li>
        <li>2 motor controller boards, 1 for the theta motor and 1 for r1 and r2</li>
        <li>2 Raspberry Pis - 1 at the center of the table (radius pi) to send commands to the 2 radii motors, and 1 below the table (theta pi) to host an Apache server running a Flask application as the UI and send radius data points to the other pi via TCP/IP</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p>
      The mechanical aspects of the table were quite interesting, and led to a fair amount of brainstorming to arrive at what electronics to use and where exactly they should be placed.
      As the images show below, the table had a slip-ring so the electronics (specifically the ODrive motor controller and raspberry pi) sitting at the center of the table could rotate freely
      with brushed connections to the stationary electronics sitting below the table, while meeting all the necessary power requirements. After some more thought, this prompted
      the use of two Raspberry Pis; the theta pi would remain stationary below the table and the rotating pi (along with the ODrive motor controller board) would be placed at 
      the center of the table, with all the electronic connections being fed through the slip ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working in polar coordinates was a natural decision, as creating designs from polar equations was the goal. As the theta motor's angle changes, the radius from the origin also changes.
      Since there was 1 diameter arm (i.e. 2 radii arms offset by 180 degrees), the theta motor only had to rotate half of the entire domain of the polar equation until a given design started to repeat itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the stationary theta pi, I installed and configured an Apache web server, and set up and deployed a simple Flask application on it using Python and SQLite.
      This served as the table's UI and allowed users to
      <ul>
        <li>create and login to their accounts</li>
        <li>add, delete, and edit polar equations</li>
        <li>specify rotational speed as a percentage of a certain maximum to allow for more or less detail (radius points) in the polar design</li>
        <li>specify the scale as a percentage of the radius of the table (could also define the polar equation with the correct scaling constants)</li>
        <li>start and stop drawing polar equations</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      I set the stationary theta pi to be responsible for 
      <ol>
        <li>accepting user input via a web interface through the Apache server</li>
        <li>sending commands to the theta motor to rotate at the appropriate speed</li>
        <li>calculate the minimum number of radians for the polar design to fully complete</li>
        <li>calculating the radius data points for motors r1 and r2 with appropriate scaling in real time, and send those points to the radius pi over the network</li>
      </ol>

      and the rotating radius pi to be responsible for 
      <ol>
        <li>accepting data points as packets from the theta pi over the network</li>
        <li>writing those data points to the radius motors, r1 and r2</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the networking, I used Python's socket library and created client and server classes relevant to this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      To convert a radius that the polar equation f(theta) outputs to an exact number of rotations to command the radius motors, I had to do some initial calibration and measurements
      on the maximum number of rotations for each radius motor to send each marble from the origin to the edge of the table. Once I acquired the necessary constants,
      this conversion from polar equation radius to motor command simply became a scaling/percentage of the maximum number of rotations each radius motor can possibly move.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, I configured each pi to run the necessary code on bootup (with appropriate delays in place), which involved creating some bash scripts on the pis.
